          available the Contest(s) comprising of 2 -– 100 Participants or any
          other pre-designated number of Participants. Win99x may create this
          format of the Contest(s) as a paid format and the Winner will be

          number of Participants required to make the Contest(s) operational
          will be pre-specified and once the number of Participants in such
          Contest(s) equals the pre-specified number required for that
          Contest(s), such Contest(s) shall be operational. In case the number
          of Participants is less than the pre-specified number at the time of
          commencement of the match, such Contest(s) will not be operational and
          the pre-designated amount paid by each Participant shall be returned
          to the account of such User without any charge or deduction. In
          certain Contests across the Win99x Services, designated as “Guaranteed

          rendered operative and no other Invited Users or Users shall be
          permitted to participate in the Private contest. In the event that any
          Private contest does not contain the pre-specified number of
          Participants for that Private contest within 1 hour prior to the
          commencement of the match/Contest, the Platform will initiate an
          automatic refund of the amount deposited. Such refund shall be

          malfunction or lack of eligibility of such Invited User to participate
          in the Contest(s).

          balance and Win99x shall issue an invoice for such debit to the User.
          The User may participate in a Contest wherein the User has to
          contribute a pre-specified contribution towards the Prize Money Pool

          accounts towards the pre-designated amount of such user shall be
          debited from the User’s Unutilized Account and thereafter, any

          Winning Account. In case there is any amount remaining to be paid by
          the User in relation to such User’s participation in any match(s) or
          Contest(s), the User will be taken to the designated payment gateway
          to give effect to such payment. In case any amount added by the User
          through such payment gateway exceeds the remaining amount of the
          pre-designated amount, the amount in excess shall be transferred to
          the User’s ‘Unutilized’ Account and will be available for use in
          participation in any match(s) or Contest(s). Debits from the
