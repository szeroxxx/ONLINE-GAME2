        <h1 className="privacy_heading">Use of Cookies:</h1>
        <p className="privacy_text">
          To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Portal for our
          Users, we use "cookies", or such similar electronic tools to collect
          information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a User
          Identification (User ID) to understand the User's individual interests
          using the identified computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies
          himself/herself (e.g., through registration), Win99x has no way of
          knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's
          computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is
          information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the
          User's hard drive. Dream11’s advertisers may also assign their own
          cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad
          banners), a process that Win99x does not control. Win99x's web servers
          automatically collect limited information about User's computer's
          connection to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User
          visits the Portal. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers
          attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such
          as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not
          identify the User personally. Win99x uses this information to deliver
          its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its Portal to the
          interests of its users, to measure traffic within the Portal and let
          advertisers know the geographic locations from where Win99x's visitors
          come.
        </p>

        <h1 className="privacy_heading">Links:</h1>
        <p className="privacy_text">
          Win99x also includes links to other websites. Such websites are
          governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond
          Win99x's control. Once the User leaves Win99x's servers (the User can
          tell where he/she is by checking the URL in the location bar on the
          User's browser), use of any information provided by the User is
          governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site which the
          User is visiting. That policy may differ from Win99x's own. If the
          User can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link
          from the site's homepage, the User may contact the site directly for
          more information. Win99x is not responsible for the privacy practices
          or the content of such websites.
